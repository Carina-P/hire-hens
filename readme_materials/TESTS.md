# Test plan
Back to [README]()
## Contents

The below plan for testing was followed during development of the site: The TDD, TestDriven Development, process is followed as much as possible. Test cases are developed/thought of, before the code is implemented. The test process is conducted in an iterative manner and implementation cycles are short with small parts of code constructed every time. In some cases, prototyping is used and the thorough test is done when I was satisfied with the prototype.

Before new code is committed, testing of all code developed earlier are repeated again.

When all features are implemented and tested, the following tests are performed:
* Go throught the test cases for functional testing and testing of responsiveness, as described below.
* HTML-code validated by [W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
* CSS-cod validated by [W3S CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* JavaScript-code validated by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
* Python code is validated by [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
* The site is tested on different browsers, as described below
* The deployed version in heroku is tested

## Test of functionality and responsiveness
Functionality tests and tests of responsiveness are done by following test cases below. Test of responsiveness is mainly performed with the help of Chrome Developers Tool.
